# credit_ml_study

## Introduction 
This is a machine learning project that is being used for study purposes. The main goal of this repository is to understand the usability of Machine Learning script decisions within credit and financial subjects, analizing it's accuracy and how it could be used in real problem solving.

The code script was written in Python (Jupyter Notebook) and i have used Sci-Kit Learn, pandas and matplotlib as the main technologies. The database i am using is a CC0 license CSV found at Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sid321axn/south-german-credit-updated) and it is also study intended, even though it is based on real credit data.

### In the first part, my main objective is to prepare tha data for testing and learning using encoding:

### Then, i am dividing what is going to be my train data from my test data, determining my parameters for the analysis right after that:

### In the last part, i am calculating the accuracy of the ML model and looking for the most important features it is using in it's analysis:

### It is important to understand that
The decision tree model was selected because of it's feature of generating scenarios. Better accuracy results can be obtained by using other models such as Linear Regression, but the goal here was to achieve something that could be used as a Credit Engine. This technology can be built using the "best model" variable and giving it real data to work and predict.

Note that reaching the final decision is not the only goal of a credit engine model: AI and Machine Learning models can be used as an insight to analists, helping them to find data patterns that are not easy to see at first sight - and i believe that this is where they shine the most.
